This is a fun little game I am building up as a learning exercise. 

For no particular reason here are some rules I have been going by:
1. Share the game and get feedback from users
2. No build step
3. One file only, index.html. Don't be sensible and put JS and CSS in a separate files
4. Just make the code work, don't be afraid of doing anything wrong 
5. Use ChatGPT as much as you can

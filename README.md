# trivi
Pronounced like trivia without the 'a'.

This is a fun little game I am building up as a learning exercise. 

For no particular reason here are some rules:
1. Have fun
2. One file only, index.html. No silly build step. Don't be sensible and put JS and CSS in separate files
3. No libraries, let the code shine
4. Just make the code work, don't be afraid of doing anything wrong 
5. Use AI as much as you can but understand what it is doing.

tri as in triangle, vi as in hex
